5. We're going to upload a dataset of raw comment files pertaining to a snippet of MKBHD's videos. He's a leading tech influencer in the space.

Here are files that we've looked: Note our API is super flexible, so we accept all sorts of datatypes

This data is super messy. Lots of languages, weird characters, no structures, etc.

6. Now we're going to actually upload a dataset (or simulate uploading one.)
	- python3 update_data --dataset_name "Sample Data" --simulate "yes"

5. Run “sumulate_run.py —dataset_name “sample dataset”
6. Show sample dataset 


Questions to Ask:
1. How technical is the audience (ranging from technical to non-technical)
2. What kinds of textual datasets do you typically see in your workflow?
3. What’s the messiest unstructured data source you wish you had insights from, but don’t today?
4. If Datadog had a ‘Plotline for logs’—automatically summarizing service degradation reports—what would that look like?
5. If you could summarize thousands of Jira comments, Slack threads, or Zendesk tickets into a single executive-ready insight, what would you use that for?
6. What internal logs, tickets, or notes do your teams regularly ignore because they’re too dense or unstructured?
7. How do you currently surface trends across incident postmortems or runbooks—do patterns ever get lost in noise?”
8. Do you ever analyze internal documentation, like confluence pages or changelogs, at scale?
9. What would a ‘voice of the customer’ summary across your NPS freeform comments look like if you used this API internally?
